Problem: Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to phi^n/sqrt(5), where phi=(1+sqrt(5))/2
Solution: 
- when n=0, Fib(0)=1/sqrt(5)=0.447 closest to 0 => correct
- assuming Fib(n)=phi^n/sqrt(5) and Fib(n+1)=phi^(n+1)/sqrt(5), prove that Fib(n+2)=phi^(n+2)/sqrt(5)
  + according to Fibonacci definition: Fib(n+2) = Fib(n) + Fib(n+1) = phi^k/sqrt(5)*(phi+1) with phi+1 = phi^2
  => proven
